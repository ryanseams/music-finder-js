Sample Mixpanel App

This sample app uses the [Mixpanel SDK](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-js) to implement features such as:

- Tracking Events
- Creating People Profiles
- Updating various Super & People Properties
- Receiving and Registering for Notifications

This example is based off of the popular "Music Finder" example app from the [Mixpanel Webinar](https://mixpanel.com/help/questions/articles/webinar-resource-page).

To use this locally and test functionality, install [Anvil](http://anvilformac.com) and add the folder where these files are stored as a new site.
